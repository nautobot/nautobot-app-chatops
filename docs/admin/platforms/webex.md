# Cisco Webex Setup

| Configuration Setting        | Mandatory? | Default | Available on Admin Config |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| `enable_webex`               | **Yes**    | False   | Yes                       |
| `webex_msg_char_limit`       | **No**     | 7439    | No                        |
| `webex_signing_secret`       | **Yes**    | --      | No                        |
| `webex_token`                | **Yes**    | --      | No                        |

1. Login to [https://developer.webex.com](https://developer.webex.com) and select "Start building apps", then "Create a New App", then "Create a Bot".
   - Enter the bot name, username, icon (you can use `nautobot_logo.png` from this directory), and description,
     and select "Add Bot"
2. Configure the displayed Bot Access Token string as the `webex_token` in your `.creds.env` file.
   It can't be recovered later, so if you lose it you'll need to log in and regenerate a new token.
3. Currently, the bot does not automatically register its own webhooks (although this is a capability that Webex
   provides, TODO?) so you'll need to set them up yourself.
   - Go to [https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/webhooks](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/webhooks)
   - *For all of these API calls, be sure you deselect "Use personal access token" and instead specify the
     Bot Access Token string as the authorization instead.*
   - If desired, you can use [https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/webhooks/list-webhooks](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/webhooks/list-webhooks) to query for existing
     webhooks. There should be none if this is a new deployment.
   - Use [https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/webhooks/create-a-webhook](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/webhooks/create-a-webhook) (again, with the bot access token) to create
     a new webhook with the following parameters:
     - name: "nautobot messages"
     - targetUrl: "https://\<server\>/api/plugins/chatops/webex/"
     - resource: "messages"
     - event: "created"
     - secret: (enter a secret string that you don't mind having passed around as plaintext)
   - Change the `resource` to "attachmentActions" and run the API call again to create a second webhook.
4. Configure the `webex_signing_secret` in your `.creds.env` to match the Webhook secret string that you selected above.
5. Proceed to the [Installation Guide](../install.md#install-guide) section.

## Deprecation Warning

As of Nautobot ChatOps App v2.0.0, there are the following changes:

- The deprecated URL API path `webex_teams` has been removed. Please use `webex` as a substitute.
- The use and deprecation warnings for the obsolete `webex_teams` App configuration entries have been removed. These entries include:
    - `enable_webex_teams` => `enable_webex`
    - `webex_teams_token` => `webex_token`
    - `webex_teams_signing_secret` => `webex_signing_secret`
- Avoid using the `WEBEX_TEAMS_TOKEN` environment variable, instead, please pass the token through the App configuration entry `webex_token`.
- Avoid using the `WEBEX_TEAMS_SIGNING_SECRET` environment variable. Please pass the secret through the App configuration entry `webex_signing_secret`.
- The `webex_msg_char_limit` entry has been relocated to the App configuration. If you wish to continue using the `WEBEX_MSG_CHAR_LIMIT` environment variable, please add the following code to your `nautobot_config.py`:
    ```python
    PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
        "nautobot_chatops": {
            "webex_msg_char_limit": int(os.getenv("WEBEX_MSG_CHAR_LIMIT", "7439")),
        }
    }
    ```

As of Nautobot ChatOps App v1.4.0, the PLUGIN_CONFIG settings for Webex has changed to align with the official renaming of `Webex Teams` to `Webex`:

- `enable_webex_teams` is deprecated. Use `enable_webex` instead.
- `webex_teams_token` is deprecated. Use `webex_token` instead.
- `webex_teams_signing_secret` is deprecated. Use `webex_signing_secret` instead.

Both settings will currently work, however support for `enable_webex_teams`, `webex_teams_token` and `webex_teams_signing_secret` will be removed in v2.0.0.
